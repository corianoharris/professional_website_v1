# Intent-Driven Color Breakdown

**Philosophy:** *"Vulnerability is the birthplace of trust. Color is that brave first whisper—evoking calm, understanding, and belonging in 0.05 seconds."*

This document breaks down every section of the site and explains **why** each color was chosen for intent and **what it communicates** to the visitor. Colors are organized by psychological purpose, not appearance.
