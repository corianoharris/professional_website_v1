## Side-by-Side Examples

### Example 1: About Section

**Current (College Level - Flesch: 54.4):**
> "I believe vulnerability creates real trust: showing up authentically, daring to feel human. Color is that brave first whisper-evoking calm, understanding, and belonging in 0.05 seconds."

**8th Grade Version (Target: Flesch: 60-69):**
> "I believe being open and honest builds real trust. When you show your true self, people connect with you. Color is the first thing people notice. It makes them feel calm, understood, and like they belong-all in less than a second."

**Changes:**
- "vulnerability" → "being open and honest" (more concrete)
- "authentically" → "your true self" (simpler)
- "daring to feel human" → removed (too abstract)
- "brave first whisper" → "first thing people notice" (more direct)
- "evoking" → "makes them feel" (simpler verb)
- Split long sentence into shorter ones

---

### Example 2: Services Section

**Current (Very Difficult - Flesch: 10.8):**
> "Designing and developing products that resonate emotionally with users, creating lasting connections and memorable experiences."

**8th Grade Version:**
> "I design and build products that people love. These products create strong connections with users. People remember these experiences for a long time."

**Changes:**
- "resonate emotionally" → "people love" (concrete emotion)
- Split complex sentence into 3 simple sentences
- "lasting connections" → "strong connections" (simpler word)
- "memorable experiences" → "remember these experiences" (more direct)

---

### Example 3: Expertise Section

**Current (Very Difficult - Flesch: -1.3):**
> "With courage and remarkability: psychology before pixels."

**8th Grade Version:**
> "I use courage and stand out from others. I think about how people feel before I design."

**Changes:**
- "remarkability" → "stand out from others" (concrete action)
- "psychology before pixels" → "think about how people feel before I design" (explains the concept)
- Split into two clear sentences

---

### Example 4: Hero Section

**Current (College Level - Flesch: 49.0):**
> "To help brave teams create remarkable products worth millions more-building instant trust, deep belonging, and viral word-of-mouth through courageous color as the spark of human connection."

**8th Grade Version:**
> "I help bold teams build amazing products that make more money. I use color to build trust fast. People feel like they belong. They tell their friends about your product. Color is what connects people."

**Changes:**
- "brave" → "bold" (simpler, still strong)
- "remarkable" → "amazing" (more common)
- "worth millions more" → "make more money" (direct)
- Split 29-word sentence into 5 shorter sentences
- "viral word-of-mouth" → "tell their friends" (concrete action)
- "spark of human connection" → "what connects people" (simpler)
