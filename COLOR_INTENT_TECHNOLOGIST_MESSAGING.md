I'm a Color Intent Technologist. I help B2B SaaS product leaders ($5M–$100M ARR) stop losing real money to color debt—errors, tickets, rework, lost conversions. Color is neuroscience, not decoration. I make every hue work harder for your users and your business.

Real color systems build real trust. Trust starts when your product doesn't hide. I build experiences where people feel seen. They choose you with confidence. They tell others about you. And you drive measurable revenue.

Philosophy: Start with why. Be real → create real trust. Build for the one billion people with a disability first—everyone benefits. Outcomes: $2M+ recovered (healthcare), $180K saved (finance), 3× checkout conversions (e-commerce). 5–10× ROI year one via the Intent-Driven Color Model™.
